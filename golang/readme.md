# ipWatch (golang)

The Golang version of ipWatch.

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-lightblue)
![golang](https://img.shields.io/badge/golang-%3E=1.20-lightblue)
![hello](https://img.shields.io/badge/hi-ðŸ‘‹-lightgray)

ipWatch keeps an eye on my external IP. If it changes then sends an email alert and optionally update CloudFlare DNS.

All pretty basic really.

There are two pieces for ipWatch. The ipWatch app and a server (simple cloud function) to send requests to for getting the current IP address.

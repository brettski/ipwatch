# ipWatch

ipWatch keeps an eye on my external IP. If it changes then sends an email alert.

ipWatch was originally built as a [nodejs](https://node.js) application. For practice and learning it has been recreated using [rust-lang](https://rust-lang.org), and [Python](https://python.org) too.

[nodejs version](./nodejs/)
